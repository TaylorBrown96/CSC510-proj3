**YOUR PLATE, YOUR RULES. PRECISION NUTRITION FOR BODY AND MIND.**

Eatsential is a LLM-powered platform that connects users to food options with unprecedented precision. By creating a holistic profile that includes allergies, fitness goals (muscle gain, weight loss, endurance), dietary preferences (vegan, keto), and even mental wellness objectives (e.g., mood-boosting foods, stress reduction), our system delivers hyper-personalized meal recommendations, recipes, and restaurant suggestions.

Get Eatsential running on your local machine in just a few steps.

### Automated Setup (Recommended) ⚡

Run our one-click setup script that handles everything automatically:

```bash
# Clone the project and navigate into it
git clone <repository-url>
cd CSC510/proj2

# Run the automated setup script
./setup.sh
```

The script will:
- ✅ Check for required tools (Bun, uv, Python)
- 📦 Install all dependencies (root, frontend, backend)
- 🔐 Generate a secure JWT secret key
- 🗄️ Initialize the database with sample data
- 🎯 Set up everything you need to start coding

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **.ENV Setting Required**
>
> Please remember to set your **Gemini API keys** in the backend `.env` file to enable AI features.

**Sample Credentials:**
- Email: `admin@example.com`
- Password: `Admin123!@#`

### Manual Setup

If you prefer manual control, see our detailed [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) guide.

### Run the Application

Start both the frontend and backend servers simultaneously from the root directory (proj2/):

```bash
bun dev
```

The application will now be running:

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:8000
- Backend API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
